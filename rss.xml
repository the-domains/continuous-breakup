            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Tesla Will Destroy the Automobile Industry</h1><p>If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire industry, it's Tesla.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Techies Project by Photographer Helena Price</h1><p>The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
